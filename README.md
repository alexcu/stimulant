# stimulant

Opinionated bootstrapper for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) projects.

## Install

Simply execute the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ssilab/stimulant.git
$ cd stimulant
$ npm install
```

## Build / Run

Execute the following command:

```bash
$ gulp watch
```

This will compile everything to a `dist/` directory and serve your website at `http://localhost:9000`. A watcher will also be spawned to ensure that re-builds automatically occur whenever files change, so just keep that running while you work.
